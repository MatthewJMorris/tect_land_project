# Notes 11am Thurs 1 Aug
#####################################
## Purpose: Brainstorm on Topic
## Aims: Have keywords and objectives of what we want to achieve

########
## Initial brainstorm
#######
* Difference between hex and raster?
* Real DEM using OpenTopography
* Synthetic examples where parameters change
* Use synthetic results to guide/compare to observed landscape results


#######
## Revised brainstorm
#######
--> Groups to split in two, divided by observed & synthetic landscapes
1. Observed Landscape (DEM): Anthony, Madison, Cho, Vivian
2. Synthetic Landscape: Aysan, Pedro, Matthew

#######
## Mentor comments
#######
* It is OK to write your own functions as basic components (e.g. single equations)
* It is too much to implement PDE's

#######
## Final Project Idea
#######
* Compare the impact of changing parameters on a landscape
* Response time to Perturbations in LEM comparing to DEM data: Study case: Teton Fault - Wyoming

### Parts for Notebook:
1- Objective with notebook
2- Geological context, K values, Uplift values, seismic recurrence of fault activity. 
3 - Methods: Concepts used to do the analysis 
- Brief theory of Chi
- Brief theory of Longitudinal Profiles
4 - Running the experiments with DEMs
5 - Running the experiments with synthetic data
6 - Comparing results
7 - Conclusion


### Components Required
* StreamPowerEroder
* FlowAccumulator
* LinearDiffuser
* Normal Fault
* ChiFinder
* ChannelProfiler
* SinkFiller?


### Tasks
* Decide on a DEM area: Teton Normal Fault
* Extract a DEM
* Decide on which parameters are going to change: Erodibility, Fracture Density
* Decide which metrics are going to be looked at: Long profiles, Chi, Morphometric parameters
* Produce a short introduction to key theory/literature:
    * Teton normal fault
    * Stream power model
    * Chi
    


####################################
* Aims by post-lunch session: Think about how we want to implement our plan
* Aims by end of day: Draft workplan with responsibilities. Who is doing what?

* Things to think about
    * What do we want to teach people?
    * What works well from other Lab examples?
